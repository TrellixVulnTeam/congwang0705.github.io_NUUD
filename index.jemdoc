== About me
I received the B.S. degree in automation (Supervisor: Professor [http://wulwxy.hhuc.edu.cn/2010/0527/c1491a27544/page.htm Yuncan Xue]) from College of Internet of Things (IOT) Engineering, [http://www.hhu.edu.cn/ Hohai University (HHU)], and the M.S. degree in mathematics (Supervisor: Associate Professor [http://jszy.hhu.edu.cn/yjb/ Jianbin Yang]) from College of Science, [http://www.hhu.edu.cn/ Hohai University (HHU)] in 2014 and 2017, respectively.
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of Professors [https://web.njit.edu/~zhou/ Mengchu Zhou] and [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhiwu_Li Zhiwu Li] at [https://www.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm Xidian University (XDU)].
I was a Visiting Ph.D. Student (Co-advisor: Professor [http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~pedrycz/ Witold Pedrycz]) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.
I was also a Research Assistant (Co-advisor: Assistant Professor [https://junzhaogroupntu.github.io/ Jun Zhao]) at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
I am currently a Visiting Ph.D. Student (Co-advisor: Professor [https://robotics.nus.edu.sg/sge/ Shuzhi Sam Ge]) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.
My research interests include Fuzzy theory, wavelet analysis and its applications, pattern recognition and image processing, granular computing, as well as computer vision. I am a member of China Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (CSIAM). [PDF/cv.pdf A brief cv is found here].
